<p><a href=https://www.jugglebee.com target="_blank">JuggleBee</a> is a Namibian online auction and marketplace platform developed using Ruby on Rails
  and aims to provide Namibians with a one-stop place to buy and sell items. It was launched in
  February 2014 and has grown steadily. November 2015 saw a complete re-write and overhall of
  the site bringing with it much needed capabilities and making it truely mobile friendly. Users
  can sign up for free via Facebook or manually and instantly start listing their items
  for sale or auction.<p>
<p>JuggleBee is my largest active project which I spend weekends and free time maintaining and adding
  new features.</p>
