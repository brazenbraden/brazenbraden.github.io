<h2>From The Beginning</h2>

<p>Ever since I first got my hands on Warcraft (it came on 4 stiffy disks) I wanted to be a game developer.
That got me into coding when I was 11. QBasic was suggested to me by a friend so thats where I began.
At school I went straight for Computer Science, learning Delphi and a little bit of Pascal. Went into
university registering for a BSc(Computer Science & Information Systems). We were taught C# and Java and
also introduced (in a short 3 month module) to HTML and web development. I was hooked and proceeded to teach
myself PHP, JavaScript and CSS.</p>

<h2>Griffin Studios</h2>
<p>After gaining enough experience making websites for a few friends, I launched Griffin Studios and offered my
services to the public. Built up a decent portfolio mainly consisting of B'nB websites (poster sites) and I
furthered my experience and knowledge of PHP using MySQL as the default datastore. I spent a lot of time going
through Photoshop tutorials and expanded my list of services to include graphic design (although I mostly just
  used those skills for the poster sites) and did have a couple requests for company logos and a restaurant menu.</p>

<h2>MSS (Media and Software Studios)</h2>
<p>My time in South Africa came to an end after getting my degree so I headed back home to my parents who were living
in Kenya at the time. I met a guy (Paul) who soon became a very good friend and he had his own company called MSS. He wasn't
really hiring but offered I come help him out which introduced me to all sorts of new tools, technologies and concepts.
Paul had some really interesting projects on the go. We came across the Kohana PHP framework which was used in a few projects
(and Paul has since become a big contributer to its development). Was my first time using a framework and taught me a lot.</p>

<h2>Current Day</h2>
<p>Now I find myself in Namibia and am currently employed in a small (just two people) in-house development studio called Westcosoft
where the current focus is developing trucking logistics software using Ruby on Rails. I have been exposed to a multitude of
technologies during my 4 year employment, including but not limited to Vagrant, Docker, MongoDB, RethinkDB, ElasticSearch and more.
In my spare time, I am the developer behind <a href=https://www.jugglebee.com target="_blank">JuggleBee</a> and work on adding new features during my spare
time, usually on the weekends. It is also build using Ruby On Rails. Every day poses a new challenge and every day I
learn something new.</p>
