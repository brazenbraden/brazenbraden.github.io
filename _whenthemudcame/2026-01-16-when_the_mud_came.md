I’ve always wanted to make a game. It’s what got me into software development in the first place. But bills have to be paid, and sometimes dreams have to be put on hold until you find the freedom to explore them. Thankfully, I found that time midway through 2025 due to an employee downsizing initiative. And so **"When the Mud Came"** slowly turned from a dream into a reality.

## About "When The Mud Came"
We all have our preferred gaming experiences. Some of us love sports or driving games. I’ve always been an FPS guy — popping heads down scope while hidden in the shadows. But with the expansion of my family, my free time (and ability to don headphones and lock into a solid gaming session) fizzled out.

I found myself drifting towards relaxing, “satisfying”, incremental games, where time pressure wasn’t a factor. **"When The Mud Came"** is a combination of these influences, taking inspiration from games like Powerwash Simulator (obviously satisfying), Planet Crafter (visible, world-altering progress), and pretty much any incremental game (for that dopamine hit).

### Who Is This Game For?
I consider this a “dad game” — something you can kick back with, relax, put on your favourite music or a background TV show, and casually clean away the muck. The satisfying ping of a fully cleaned surface, the steady drip of incremental upgrades, and the slow visual feedback as life returns to the world are all part of the experience.

If that sounds like your kind of game, **"When The Mud Came"** might be for you.

### The Story
You play as an unknown protagonist, stuck in a dead-end life loop of wake up, go to work, eat a TV dinner, and repeat — something I think a lot of us can relate to.

One day, breaking news: a mysterious volcano, spewing some form of mud, appears out of nowhere, covering half a continent in brown sludge. Entire towns are coated and residents evacuated. Dust fills the air. The environment is harsh and hostile.

An advert pops up after the news. Maybe it’s government-sponsored, maybe it’s just coincidence. Big money to be made in power-washing.

This sparks an idea.

You already have an old, dusty power washer tucked away in your garage. Maybe this is life throwing you a nickel — a chance to break out of the rut, do something new, and make some serious money. You decide to act: dig out your trusty old friend, load up the truck, and hit the road. Destination: the mud volcano.

But one must ask… why did this mysterious volcano appear in the first place? And where did it come from?

The mud it spews isn’t “normal”. Is it alien? Or the result of a black-site government experiment gone wrong? All will be revealed in time.

### Route 66
Route 66 is the first stop on the way to the mud volcano, and the location where the demo takes place.

This is the first level of the game. While additional content will be added to this location later, it currently serves as a prototype level that demonstrates the core systems and mechanics.

You stop at a roadside services area featuring a petrol station with a shop and a motel. There’s a bus stop and a children’s play area attached to the motel. Scattered around the level you’ll find newspapers that build the wider world story, journals from scientists detailing the nature of the mud, and a series of notes from a madman hinting that there’s something more lurking out there.

### Gameplay loop
The map starts off looking very brown. Mud everywhere, trapped inside a dust storm.

As you clean, the world slowly begins to recover. The dust storm dissipates, storm clouds fade, the sun breaks through, and greenery returns. The level is split into a series of zones, and upon fully cleaning a zone, it comes to life in some way.

Cleaning earns you money, which can be spent on upgrades for both your power washer and yourself. Power washer upgrades improve the cleaning experience, making it faster and more efficient, while increasing earnings. Physical abilities also need to be unlocked — such as jump and double jump — allowing you to reach previously inaccessible areas, or “dirt vision” to help locate those stubborn patches of grime you might have missed.

Once the entire level is cleaned and all required readables have been collected (newspapers and journals are mandatory, as they’re critical to the story — notes are optional and serve as side stories and flavour), your vehicle becomes available, ending the demo with a short cutscene.

## Where to from here?
I have big dreams for **"When The Mud Came"**. Multiple large locations, new equipment and tech trees, multiple story threads, puzzles, and hidden secrets.

There’s still a lot of work to do. This is an alpha demo after all, so bugs are expected. The shader and particle systems are functional, but I feel they need the most work. I’ve always intended the game to lean towards a more cartoony visual style. The Synty packs I’ve used work well for now, but I want to push the visuals further over time by creating more custom assets. As a programmer, the worlds of art, 3D modelling, particles, shaders and animation are all very new to me.

For now, I will be constantly working on any issues and the gameplay systems. I hope you enjoy the alpha demo. If you do, please leave a comment on the itch.io page (https://brazenbraden.itch.io/when-the-mud-came) — and I’ll see you down the road.
