## My Programming Life in a Nutshell
Started teaching myself QBASIC when I was 11. Having played Warcraft, my future profession was set - I wanted to make games. In school, learnt some Pascal and Delphi, got top in my class. BSc(InfoSys) was my degree of choice when entering Rhodes University. Picked up all sorts of new skills and languages including C#, ASM and Haskell. Had a single semester of web development (basic CSS and HTML) and I was hooked at the speed of thought to visual result. Game design was put on the back burner (for now).

Started my own freelance web design (PHP & MySQL) company while at university, Giffin Studios. Moved to Mombasa and work with MSS doing more PHP via the Kohana Framework. Spent 5 years in Namibia at Westcosoft doing XOJO and then learning RoR. Needing a bigger challenge, decided to come to London and join the real rat race. 6 years later, worked my way up through BigSofa Technologies from Mid to Lead Backend Engineer. One is never done learning and even though I consider myself a talented developer and team leader, every day I have a slice of humble pie learning something new along the way.
