So I have finished (for now) with the [About Me](/about/index.html) and [My Projects](/projects/index.html) pages.
This will also be the last blog post about general web content modifications for this website you will be glad to hear.
The projects I am currently working on are introducing me to all sorts of new techniques and patterns which I am quite
interested in sharing once I have a little more experience with them. I am also working on a little play project
which will be implementing many of these patterns in Ruby on Rails to hopefully act as an interesting resource. It is
on github but currently still a work in progress. Will keep you updated on that one.

Other plans for this blog include talking about Ruby on Rails, Vagrant, Docker and other cool and interesting
technologies and tools which I have the privilege of working with. They really make development fun and simple
especially when it comes to having to deploy production code. I will talk about my development environment, choice of IDEs,
general work-flow and more. Exciting and fun times ahead!!
