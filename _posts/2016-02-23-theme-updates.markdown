I've always liked the darcula theme ever since I first saw the option for it in RubyMine years ago
and since then it has grown very popular. Atom, which I also use (coincidentally right now as I write this)
also benefits from the dark and easy-on-the-eyes theme so hey, why not update my theme to match? Yes, its
not original but since when is anything these days?

Also added the Projects page which as of yet has no content but will be the home of the projects I have
and am working on. My main project (and focus on the weekends) is [JuggleBee](https://www.jugglebee.com)
but more on that later once I have the projects page done.

From a development standpoint, I'm busy figuring out how exactly to implement the Repository pattern with
a good architecture in a Rails app. Once I have figured more of it out, I will be sure to drop a post here
with my experiences and what I have learnt (always some more to learn isn't there).
