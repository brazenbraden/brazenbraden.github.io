Well today has been a day full of new and interesting things. Primarily, this very page you have glanced upon!
I knew about [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a while now but never took the time to investigate it much further... until now.
It was straightforward enough and here I am, 30 minutes later, with a working Jekyll installation (mind you,
a rather boring looking one but a theme will be on its way shortly.)

What else is new today? Well, and this is rather mind-blowing, I have, after many many years of extensive use,
finally signed up with StackOverflow. They are a resource I use every day but never bothered to actually sign up
and lend my hand in contributions. It's about time I crawled out from the dark ages.

Anyway, enough of all that. What is the purpose of this blog you may be asking? I do not have a set direction in
mind however I felt it would be good to put down some of my ramblings and perhaps some useful ideas / solutions / whatever
that I come across while I continue to learn. I am playing with a lot of new and interesting tools and softwares and
want to share some of my experiences and discoveries (if no one is interested, well, then this will just serve as a personal
journal).  

Right, that's enough for the first ever post (yay me!). Time to get playing with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and see what I can do with her(him? it?).
